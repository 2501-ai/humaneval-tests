def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    
    Examples:
        >>> search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1])
        2
        >>> search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4])
        3
        >>> search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])
        -1
    '''
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each integer in the list
    freq = Counter(lst)
    
    # Initialize the result as -1
    result = -1
    
    # Iterate through the frequency dictionary
    for num, count in freq.items():
        # Check if the frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself
